	<h3>What is Stored Procedure?</h3>
	<p>A procedure has a name, a parameter list, and SQL statement(s).
	A stored procedure can be invoked by triggers, other stored procedures, and applications such as Java, Python, PHP
	</p>

	<h3>Advantages of Stored Procedure</h3>
	<p>
	Write Once and Execute Anywhere. It is reusable and transparent to any applications.
	It is secure. The database administrator can grant appropriate permissions to applications that access stored procedures that manipulate the data but not directly to the tables. SP is now a bridge, bridging the user and the table, to which the user has no direct access.
	</p>

	<h3>Drawbacks of Stored Procedure</h3>
	<p>It increases work load on the database server.
	It is not easy to develop and maintain stored procedures. Developing and maintaining stored procedures are often required a specialized skill set that not all application developers possess. This may lead to problems in both application development and maintenance phases.
